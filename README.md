### Hi there 

- I have a Doctorate and a Master's degree in Philosophy. 
- So far, my research has been focus on the concept of *sophrosyne* in Homer, Plato, and Aristotle.
- I'm also interested in ancient philosophy in general, political science, the greek language, digital philology, and the digital humanities more broadly.
- I am keen to share macros, workflows, and scripts I developed in my research. Part of this effort has been documented in the *Tropical Classicist's Digital Guide* ([*Guia Digital do Classicista dos Trópicos*](https://gdct.blot.im)), a digital humanities project to divulge resources in the Portuguese language. 
- I also have a life long interest in integral theory/psychology, contemplative practice (especially within the Theravada tradition) and the great religous traditions in general.
- Some of my projects...
