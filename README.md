### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I received a Ph.D. in Philosophy. I researched the ancient greek value term *sophrosyne* in Homer, Plato, and Aristotle.
- 🌱 I’m primarily interested in Aristotle, Plato, and ancient philosophy in general. 
- 🌱 I'm also interested in digital philology, digital humanities & the greek language.
- 🌱 I take time, whenever possible, to share many of the macros, workflows, and scripts I developed in my research.
- 🌱 I am responsible for the *Digital Guide of the Tropics Classicist* ([*Guia Digital do Classicista dos Trópicos*](https://gdct.blot.im)), a digital humanities project to divulge resources in the Portuguese language.
- 🌱 I am also responsible for the website with the work of the literaty critic [Leo Gilson Ribeiro](https://leogilsonribeiro.com.br).
- 👯 I’m available for collaborating/hire on projects envolving academic-oriented software such as [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview), [Bookends](https://www.sonnysoftware.com/bookends-for-mac), [DEVONthink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink), [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html), [Tinderbox](http://www.eastgate.com), [Atlas.ti](https://atlasti.com/).
- 👯 I’m available for collaborating/hire on projects envolving macOS scripting (Applescript and Ruby) & automation software ([Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com), [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/)).
- 💬 Ask me about anything related to these software.
- 💬 Ask me about academic research on ancient philosophy.
- 💬 Ask me about academic research on Plato & Aristotle.
- 💬 Ask me about integral theory/psychology, insight meditation (*a.k.a.* *Vipassana*) & Theravada Buddhism.
